                    <p class="text-muted text-italics">Student Intern, Data Science</p>
                    <p>During the summer of 2018, I worked with the Data Science team of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Mount Sinai Health System 
                      in New York. It is a non-profit organization within the overarching Mount Sinai ecosystem that focuses on global health and epidemiologic 
                      advancements in the developing world.</p>
                      
                    <p>My specific project, of which I was the sole owner, dealt with an innovative way of utilizing the data at hand. Mosquitoes were a health hazard 
                      in the area and abandoned tires were attributed as a major contributor since it is very easy for water to be collected in them and act as 
                      breeding sites for mosquitoes. To tackle that, we used data that consisted of a set of images(both RGB and Infrared) which were aerial shots 
                      of multiple cities in Guatemala taken using drones. The preliminary dataset consisted of around 7000 images. In the time that was available, 
                      I designed a preliminary deep learning solution based on Convolutional Neural Networks that accepted these images as input with bounding 
                      box annotations for the abandoned tires and predicted the locations of abandoned tires in new drone images. The implementation was based on 
                      the YOLO v3 algorithm, which was chosen for its efficiency to detect small objects, since each tire was a small object in each image. </p>  
                      
                    <p>One of the major challenges we faced was to decide whether bounding boxes should be of fixed size and if so, what the size should be. 
                       This was particularly important since tires are small objects in comparison to the size of the image and the differences in size between 
                       different types of tires aren't significant compared to the image size. To decide on an ideal bounding box size to cater to all tires,
                       we identified one of the largest tires available for commercial vehicles in Guatemala and found out its dimensions. But to know how this
                       translated into the size in the image, we had to know the drone flight altitude. For this, we identified freight trucks that were visible in the
                       image and took out their actual dimensions, following which we used that in conjunction with dimensions in the image and the camera's focal length 
                       to formulaically reverse engineer the drone altitude and derive ideal bounding box sizes. </p>

                    <p class="text-muted text-italics">Head Data Scientist</p>
                    <p>Safecity is a non-profit based out of Mumbai, India with partners in Nepal, Kenya, Cameroon, Nigeria, Malaysia, United States among others
                       which crowd maps data on gender-based harassment and uses innovative Data Analytics to combat it. I set up Safecity's formal data team in 
                       mid-2015 and led it for 2 years as it grew. Under my leadership, Safecity's data team attained structure and grew manifold with many new 
                       successful initiatives taken up.</p>

                    <p>One of the first and most influential initiatives I took up was to create a fresh dashboard based on the data that was collected by the organization. Initially 
                       created using Advanced Ms Excel, the dashboard was very extensive, cutting across different harassment types, temporal variables such as day,
                       week, month, and year as well as geographical locations down to zipcode. The highlight of the dashboard was that it was completely dynamic, and 
                       would update itself fully on a regular basis as and when new data came in. This dashboard was regularly sent over to police forces and administration 
                       on an interntaional level to impact beat patrol timings and influence policy-level changes and is still being updated and used today.</p>

                    <p>One of the other major initiatives I led was the analysis of the organization's social media feed. We mined tweets and posts from the 
                       organization's twitter and facebook feeds and extracted trends and patterns regarding what our followers were talking about, 
                       how much impact our posts are able to make, what helps the cause and what does not and more. The analysis also expanded to basic NLP 
                       on the text of the tweets and posts to mine more hidden insights. The Twitter analysis in particular was largely appreciated and was used 
                       by the CEO at many international events and conferences to illustrate the power of social media in combating gender-based harassment.</p>
                     
                    <p>Further, over the course of 2 years, I mentored close to 30 entry level data analyst volunteers and trained them to mentor many more.
                       In addition, I took the lead on the organization's collaborations with many major universities. Namely,
                       <ul>
                         <li>We partnered with Stanford University's CS 50 : 'Using Tech for Good' course where a group of students worked with us over a 
                             semester to design a data-driven mobile interface. I was the liaison for the project and the lead from the organization.
                         </li>
                         <li>We had been working Dr. Susan Sorenson and Lauren Gurfein at the Ortner Center for Family Violence at the University of Pennsylvania 
                             to map street harassment in India. I took up the lead for the project and developed dynamic dashboards to help analyze the survey data
                         </li>
                         <li>We collaborated with Dr. Suzanne Lea at the University of Maryland to understand trends in transportation harassment in India. Our
                             research culminated in a research <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41300-017-0028-1">paper</a> in the Springer

                       Global Eagle over the summer of 2017 in a project aimed at increasing the efficiency of bandwidth allocation.</p> 
                       
                       <p>The organization was looking at a potential research to understand the trends of usage of different kinds of apps and websites on their networks so that they could 
                       optimize the allocation of bandwidth to prevent wastage. Using real-time usage data as input and cloud infrastructure, I created an 
                       extensive interactive dashboard on Tableau that enabled users within the organization to track usage patterns and make bandwidth allocation 
                       decisions in real-time. The initiative was the first step towards planned organizational savings of $7 million in the short-term</p>

                    <p>Omaxe is one of the leading real estate development firms in India that employs over a 1000 people with the number of contractors coming 
                       out to be many times that number. I kick started Omaxe's data science initiatives by directly assisting the Chief Operating Officer of the 
                       medium-sized firm.</p>
                    
                    <p>The COO was looking to optimize the purchase of construction materials on a daily basis based on the demand and the prices of each item till the 
                       previous day. We implemented basic time series models on past data to forecast predictions and kept improving predictions as each day's data 
                       came in. However, my biggest contribution to this role and to the organization came as an initiative I took up beyond my assigned roles. An 
                       extensive dashboard was being manually created every day based on the data that comes in that day and was being passed on to 
                       the COO so that she could understand trends and make decisions. I found this process extremely monotonous, inefficient and repetitive and 
                       decided to try and improve it through automation. The following were the steps involved in the process:
                       <ul>
                         <li>The daily data came in as an attachment via an automatically generated email</li>
                         <li>A dashboard with a fixed format had to be created based on this data and additional charts had to be generated</li>
                         <li>The files had to be compressed into a zip</li>
                         <li>The zip had to be emailed to the COO with metadata about the dashboard in the email body</li>
                       </ul>

                      <p>Utilizing a combination of R, Python, VBA, and MS Excel, I created a co-existing framework that identified that day's email in in my inbox,
                         downloaded it, created a dashboard and charts from it, compressed the files and attached them and emailed them to the COO with supplementary 
                         information. The framework was hosted on top of a task scheduler so that the entire process occurred seamlessly on its own every day morning.

                      <p><b>The initiative was well appreciated and it cut down the daily time involvement from 4-5 hours with 100% human involvement to under 2

                    <p class="text-muted text-italics">Business Analyst</p>
                    <p>ZS Associates is a global sales and marketing Consultancy based out of Evanston, IL primarily focusing on broad analytics for 
                      Pharmaceutical Corporations. As a Business Analyst at ZS, I was involved in creating long-term strategy for an upcoming Business unit of a 
                      leading US-based Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Corporation. For this, we dynamically extracted insights from highly descriptive text to 
                      create broad themes updated over time.</p>

                    <p>I also worked in Predictive Analytics, creating and optimizing prediction systems to predict physicians based on sets of 
                       Twitter data and predict Medical Insurance Premiums based on a wide array of variables. R was the tool of choice to implement generalized 
                       non-linear regression modeling for the purpose. My effort was able to come up with better results than 48 other similar efforts.</p>
                        
                    <p>I also worked in time series prediction of pharmaceutical product sales, where an ARIMA variant implemented in R emerged the final 
                       best model. In line with the previous project, this one was better than 50 other similar efforts.</p>
                        
                    <p>The project of the largest scale that I worked on here, was one to predict the presence of the 'Pap Smear Test' for Cervical Cancer in the 
                       medical history of female patients, based on diverse data such as Physician visits, diagnosis, prescriptions etc. The data was spread out 
                       across 11 tables which we hosted on a Teradata Server. The features were engineered using domain knowledge into a total of 684 predictors 
                       for 1.5 million female patients and both R and Python were used to model the data, hosted on an AWS server. The well-balanced dataset gave 
                       almost 91% accuracy for our prediction model.</p>

                    <p>GSG is a telecommunication services firm based in Masschusetts with a Global Delivery Center in Pune, India. I worked with one of the 
                       co-founders of the firm in a market segmentation project. 
                       
                       The firm was interested to create specialized recommendations for their customers based on their usage patterns of telecommunication services 
                       offered to them. I created an unsupervised machine learning solution for the organization's customer base using data about their service usage. 
                       The solution was based on a bootstrapped K-Means algorithm and went on to assist the organization in planning and offering specific plans to 
                       customers based on their segment.</p>
